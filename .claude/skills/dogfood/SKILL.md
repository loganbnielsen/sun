description: Run a developer dogfood pass of Sun. Executes the golden path from sun new workspace through curl against a live service, times each step, and logs every friction point. Produces a dated report in project/dogfood/ and materialises blocking findings as ticket files in project/tickets/READY_FOR_ENGINEERING/.

# /dogfood — Golden Path Dogfood Run

Executes the full Sun developer golden path as a first-time user would, following
the runbook at `docs/dogfood/DOGFOOD.md`. Times every step, records friction, and
determines whether the two-minute deploy claim holds on a live local substrate.

Writes a completed report to `project/dogfood/RUN_<YYYY-MM-DD>.md` and materialises
each blocking or high-friction finding as a ticket in
`project/tickets/READY_FOR_ENGINEERING/`.

## Ticket directory structure

```
project/tickets/
  BACKLOG/                  ← captured but not yet ready to act on
  READY_FOR_ENGINEERING/    ← actionable; blocking findings land here
  IN_PROGRESS/              ← worktree exists, work underway
  REVIEW/                   ← work submitted; awaiting /review-worktree
  READY_TO_MERGE/           ← review passed; human merges
  DONE/                     ← merged
```

## Steps

### 1. Read the runbook

Read `docs/dogfood/DOGFOOD.md` in full before starting.

### 2. Check previous runs

Read the most recent report in `project/dogfood/` (highest date). Note which
friction items were logged — verify whether they are now resolved before logging
them again.

Check all `project/tickets/` subdirectories for existing `FRIC-*` ticket files.
A finding already tracked anywhere in `project/tickets/` should not be
re-materialised. If it exists in `DONE/`, mark it resolved in the report.

### 3. Prepare the binary

Build the current CLI from the Sun checkout and place it first on PATH:

```bash
cd <sun-checkout>
eval $(opam env)
dune build cli/sun/bin/main.exe
export SUN_HOME=$(pwd)
mkdir -p "$SUN_HOME/.dogfood-bin"
ln -sf "$SUN_HOME/_build/default/cli/sun/bin/main.exe" "$SUN_HOME/.dogfood-bin/sun"
export PATH="$SUN_HOME/.dogfood-bin:$PATH"
hash -r
```

### 4. Run the golden path

Use a fresh workspace name (e.g. `dogfood-<YYYY-MM-DD>`). Record elapsed time
for each command using `/usr/bin/time -f 'elapsed=%E'` or `date +%s%3N` before
and after.

Work through each step in order. If a step fails, record the failure in the
friction log, attempt to diagnose it, and continue with subsequent steps where
possible.

**Steps to run:**

1. `sun new workspace <name>` — scaffold
2. `cd <name> && dune build` — build generated workspace
3. `sun dev up` — provision or reconcile local substrate (k3d cluster)
4. `sun up` — build Docker images, push, deploy
5. `sun migrate --table <name>_migrations` — apply DB migrations
6. `sun status` — check pods
7. `curl http://localhost:8080/health`
8. `curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/charges -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{"customer_id":"cus_dogfood","amount_cents":999,"currency":"usd"}'`
9. Wait up to 10s for worker to consume, then `curl http://localhost:8080/notifications`

For step 9: verify the notification row was written by `notify_worker` consuming
a Kafka event, not directly inserted by the HTTP service. If the row is present,
the Kafka path is proven.

### 5. Evaluate the two-minute claim

After step 4 (`sun up`), measure the wall-clock time from `sun new workspace`
through first successful `curl /health`. Does it stay under two minutes on an
existing substrate?

Note: `sun dev up` on a fresh cluster takes ~5 min and is substrate
bootstrap — it does not count against the two-minute claim.

### 6. Write the report

Create `project/dogfood/RUN_<YYYY-MM-DD>.md` using the template from
`docs/dogfood/DOGFOOD.md`. Fill in:

- Tool versions actually observed
- Timing for every step
- Whether the flow completed without manual intervention
- Friction log entries for every step that required knowledge outside the
  command output or docs, produced a confusing message, or failed
- Findings section for non-obvious correctness or UX observations
- List of any tickets filed

### 7. Materialise tickets

For each friction log entry where **Blocks two-minute claim? yes**, or any
correctness finding that would prevent a user from completing the flow:

1. Search all `project/tickets/` subdirectories for `FRIC-NNN`. If found, skip.
2. If not found, create `project/tickets/READY_FOR_ENGINEERING/FRIC-NNN.md`:

```markdown
---
id: FRIC-NNN
type: dogfood-finding
severity: <blocker|high|medium|low>
source: project/dogfood/RUN_<YYYY-MM-DD>.md
---

**Depends on:** None.

<one-line title>

**Description:** <what happened>

**Impact:** <what a first-time user would experience>

**Remediation:** <specific, actionable fix>
```

Assign FRIC IDs starting from one above the highest existing `FRIC-*` ID across
all `project/tickets/` subdirectories. If none exist, start at `FRIC-001`.

Medium and low friction items that do not block the flow go in the report only —
do not create tickets for them unless they recur across multiple runs.

Do not set `branch:` or `worktree:` — those are written by `/work` when
implementation begins.
