description: Run a technical production-readiness audit of the Sun codebase. Checks security, runtime correctness, data integrity, and infrastructure synthesis against the principles in docs/audits/AUDIT.md. Produces a dated report in project/audits/ and materialises open findings as ticket files in project/tickets/READY_FOR_ENGINEERING/.

# /audit — Production Readiness Audit

Works through every section of `docs/audits/AUDIT.md` by reading the actual source files and verifying each invariant holds. Writes a completed report to `project/audits/<YYYY-MM-DD>_audit.md` and materialises each open finding as a ticket in `project/tickets/READY_FOR_ENGINEERING/`.

The audit must evaluate both operational readiness and mission alignment: autonomous domain teams, typed event contracts, generated infrastructure, explicit security, framework-owned lifecycles, and AI-agent-friendly conventions.

## Ticket directory structure

```
project/tickets/
  BACKLOG/                  ← captured but not yet ready to act on
  READY_FOR_ENGINEERING/    ← actionable; this is where new findings land
  IN_PROGRESS/              ← worktree exists, work underway
  REVIEW/                   ← work submitted; awaiting /review-worktree
  READY_TO_MERGE/           ← review passed; human merges
  BLOCKED_BY_PERFORMANCE/   ← perf regression; needs fix or sign-off
  DONE/                     ← merged
```

## Steps

### 1. Read the template
Read `docs/audits/AUDIT.md` in full before starting. This is the checklist you will work through.

### 2. Determine today's date
Use the current date for the output filename in `YYYY-MM-DD` format.

### 3. Check previous findings
Read the most recent report in `project/audits/` (highest date). Note which findings were already open — verify whether they are now resolved before logging them again.

Check all `project/tickets/` subdirectories for existing AUDIT-* ticket files. A finding already tracked anywhere in `project/tickets/` should not be re-materialised. If a finding exists in `DONE/`, mark it resolved in the report.

### 4. Work through each section

For each checklist item in `docs/audits/AUDIT.md`, read the relevant source files and determine whether the invariant passes or fails. Do not rely on memory or assumptions — read the code.

**Section 1 — Local Developer Loop (`cli/sun/bin/`, `cli/sun/lib/sun_cli_scaffold.ml`):**
- Read `cmd_new.ml` to verify generated workspaces compile cleanly and library names are workspace-namespaced
- Check `cmd_up.ml` and `cmd_deploy.ml` for failure-path behaviour and rollback

**Section 2 — Infrastructure Synthesis (`cli/sun/lib/sun_cli_manifest.ml`):**
- Read `sun_cli_manifest.ml` in full
- Check `deployment_doc` and `cronjob_doc` for `runAsNonRoot`, `runAsUser`, `seccompProfile`, `readOnlyRootFilesystem`, `allowPrivilegeEscalation`
- Check `service_doc` for `type: ClusterIP` (not `NodePort`)
- Check `secret_doc` exists and `default_cluster_secrets` contains no plaintext passwords
- Check `network_policy_doc` is included in `render`
- Verify all `Sys.command` calls use `Filename.quote`

**Section 3 — Core Runtime (`~/Code/kafka-eio/kafka-eio-core/lib/kafka_stubs.c`, `~/Code/kafka-eio/kafka-eio-consumer/lib/kafka_consumer.ml` — extracted to the standalone `kafka-eio` opam package, no longer in this repo; `framework/sun-worker/lib/worker.ml`, `cli/sun/bin/cmd_new.ml`):**
- Read `kafka_stubs.c` — for every blocking librdkafka call, verify `caml_release_runtime_system()` before and `caml_acquire_runtime_system()` after
- Check `pause_partition` and `resume_partition` for `CAMLparam`/`CAMLreturn`
- Read `kafka_consumer.ml` — verify `acked` ref and warning in both `consume` and `consume_partitioned`
- Read `cmd_new.ml` — verify `ack ()` placement in worker templates
- Read `kafka_service.ml` — verify `produce_await` result is checked before `ack ()`

**Section 4 — Observability (`integrations/kafka/kafka-eio-service/lib/kafka_service.ml`, `framework/sun-svc/lib/`):**
- Read `parse_base_url` — verify `https://` is handled
- Read `default_on_decode_error` — check for structured log line, Prometheus counter, dead-letter option

**Sections 8–9 — Mission alignment and framework boundary:**
- Read `README.md`, `docs/planning/ROADMAP.md`, and `docs/guides/TUTORIAL.md` for the stated architecture and user promise
- Read `cmd_new.ml` scaffold templates and the reference workspaces under `examples/venus/` / `examples/pluto/`
- Verify event contracts are owned under `events/<team>/` and consumers import contracts, not producer service internals
- Verify generated names and labels preserve workspace/domain/service ownership
- Verify `Sun.Service.Make`, `Sun.Worker.Make`, and `Sun.Fn.Make` own lifecycle concerns in generated apps
- Verify package specs and user-facing docs do not claim commands or guarantees that are unavailable

### 5. Write the report

Create `project/audits/<YYYY-MM-DD>_audit.md` with:
- A header showing the date and which findings from the previous report changed status
- Every checklist section with `[x]` / `[ ]` and finding IDs
- A Findings section with `Status: Open` or `Status: Resolved`
- A summary table

Assign finding IDs continuing from the highest AUDIT-NNN across all existing `project/tickets/` files and previous reports.

Do not copy resolved findings forward unless their status changed.

### 6. Materialise tickets

For each finding with `Status: Open` in the report:

1. Search all `project/tickets/` subdirectories for `<id>.md`. If found anywhere, skip.
2. If not found, create `project/tickets/READY_FOR_ENGINEERING/<id>.md`:

```markdown
---
id: <AUDIT-NNN>
type: audit-finding
severity: <critical|high|medium|low>
source: project/audits/<YYYY-MM-DD>_audit.md
---

<one-line title>

**Description:** <from finding>

**Impact:** <from finding>

**Remediation:** <from finding>
```

Do not set `branch:` or `worktree:` — those are written by `/start` when work begins.
