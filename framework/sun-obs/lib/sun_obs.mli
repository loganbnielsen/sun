(** Sun's app-facing observability facade.

    [Obs_eio] stays the neutral event/backend core; this module owns Sun's
    env conventions (which backends to wire up, from what env vars),
    provider bootstrap (Loki/Prometheus/Tempo composed together), and the
    ergonomic logging/metrics/tracing methods generated apps and app
    handlers call. Generated code should depend on [sun_obs], not directly
    on [obs-loki-eio]/[obs-prometheus-eio]/[obs-tempo-eio], unless it is
    intentionally doing provider-specific work.

      let obs = Sun_obs.of_env ~net:env#net ~clock:env#clock
                  ~mono_clock:env#mono_clock ~service:"payments-charge-svc"
                  ~context:[("team", "payments")] () in
      Sun_obs.log_info obs "starting up";
      Sun_obs.with_span obs "handle_charge" (fun sp ->
        Sun_obs.log sp Sun_obs.Info "charging customer";

(** Reads [LOKI_URL] and [TEMPO_URL] from the environment and composes
    whichever backends are configured: a Prometheus backend is always
    present; Loki is added when [LOKI_URL] is a non-empty env var, Tempo
    when [TEMPO_URL] is. Logs fall back to stdout when [LOKI_URL] is unset
    (Sun's local-dev default — see the top-level CLAUDE.md's "dev mirrors
    prod" principle: the same [of_env] call works unmodified against
    `sun dev up`'s real Loki/Tempo instances once those env vars are set by
    the platform). *)

    calls or a duration belong to the same unit of work. *)

val with_span : t -> ?parent:Obs_trace.t -> string -> (span -> 'a) -> 'a
(** Opens a span, runs the callback, closes the span on every exit path —
    see {!Obs_eio.with_span} for the full contract (this is that function,
    under Sun's facade). *)

(** Log within an open {!with_span} callback — see {!Obs_eio.log}. *)

val current_trace_context : span -> Obs_trace.t
(** The open span's trace context — pass this as {!with_span}'s [?parent] to
    link a child span (including one created by another process, e.g. a
    Kafka consumer's handler receiving it from a producer's message header),
    or as [Kafka_service.publish]'s [~trace_ctx] to propagate it over a W3C
    [traceparent] header. See {!Obs_eio.current_trace_context}. *)

val trace_id_string : Obs_trace.t -> string
(** The trace ID as a lowercase hex string (W3C [traceparent] format) —

    {!Obs_eio.register_gauge}/{!Obs_eio.register_histogram}, which these

    [?context] up front. *)

(** {2 Framework primitive internals}

    [sun-svc], [sun-worker], and [sun-fn]'s own [run] functions all take a
    single [?ot:Sun_obs.t] directly now — these accessors are what each
    primitive uses internally to get back to the lower-level [Obs_eio.t]/
    renderer/backend it actually needs (registering metrics, serving
    [/metrics], pushing to Pushgateway). Application code has no reason to
    call these; use the functions above instead. *)

val obs_eio : t -> Obs_eio.t
(** What [sun-svc]/[sun-worker] register per-request/per-message metrics
    against internally. *)

val metrics_renderer : t -> unit -> string
(** What [sun-svc]/[sun-worker] render their built-in [/metrics] endpoint
    from internally — the Prometheus text-exposition renderer, regardless
    of which other backends are composed in. *)

val backend_and_renderer : t -> Obs_eio.backend * (unit -> string)
(** What [sun-fn] builds its own job-scoped [Obs_eio.t] from internally —
    the full composed backend (every configured provider fanned out
    together, not Prometheus alone) paired with the same renderer as
    {!metrics_renderer}, matching the shape [Obs_prometheus.create]
    returns. *)
