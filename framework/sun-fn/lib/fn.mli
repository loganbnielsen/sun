      (** Runs via the AWS Lambda Runtime API loop ([lambda-eio]) instead of
          once-and-exit — see [aws-audit.md] and [lambda-eio.md] for the
          full design. Not a general event-processing trigger: v1 does not
          thread the Lambda event payload into [F.run] at all, matching
          this module's existing "run once, report status" contract; a
          Lambda-triggered [-fn] is a cron job hosted on Lambda instead of a
          Kubernetes CronJob, not an S3/SQS/DynamoDB-Streams event handler. *)

        If absent, metrics are recorded in-process but not pushed. *)
    -> ?job:string
    (** Pushgateway job label. Defaults to the cron schedule string for
        [Cron], or ["lambda"] for [Lambda]. *)
    -> ?ot:Sun_obs.t
    (** Observability handle. Its composed backend + renderer are used for
        this invocation's metrics and push; defaults to a bare
        [Obs_prometheus.create ()] backend when absent. *)
    -> ?stop:unit Eio.Promise.t
    (** External stop signal. [Cron] returns [`Signalled] without starting a new
        run if it is already resolved; [Lambda] leaves the runtime loop after
        the current invocation. *)
    -> unit
    -> (unit, run_error) result
  (** [Cron _]: run [F.run ()] once, record metrics, push to Pushgateway if
      configured, then return. [F.run () = Error msg] becomes [Error (`Run msg)].
      Ordinary exceptions from [F.run] become [Error (`Run ...)] while Eio
      cancellation and fatal runtime exceptions continue to propagate. SIGTERM
      or SIGINT returns [Error `Signalled].

      [Lambda]: loop forever via [Lambda_runtime.run_loop] ([lambda-eio]),
      calling [F.run ()] once per invocation and recording/pushing metrics
      per invocation — never exits on a successful invocation. A single
      invocation's [Error msg] is reported to the Runtime API via
      [Lambda_runtime.respond_error] and the loop continues. On SIGTERM/SIGINT
      the loop stops after finishing
      whatever invocation is currently in flight (a Lambda execution
      environment being frozen/shut down sends SIGTERM — this is expected,
      routine shutdown, not the abnormal-exit signal [Cron]'s exit code 130
      represents), then this function returns normally instead of exiting
      the process — a Lambda runtime process should not call [exit] itself;
      the execution environment manages the process lifecycle. Requires
      [AWS_LAMBDA_RUNTIME_API] to be set, otherwise returns [Error (`Config ...)]. *)
