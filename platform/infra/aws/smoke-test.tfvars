# Minimal-footprint override for live smoke-testing platform/infra/aws/ —
# NOT for real workspaces. Two t3.medium nodes are the smallest shape we've
# found that can run the full base platform stack in EKS; EKS control plane's
# flat hourly charge still applies regardless of node sizing.
#
# Usage:
#   sun cloud apply dev/aws/us-east-1 \
#     --var cluster_name=sun-smoke-<you>
#
# cluster_name is deliberately not set here — pick a unique cluster_name per
# run. When using `sun cloud plan dev/aws/us-east-1`, Sun derives
# create_rds=false from the merged Sun config because that target omits the
# Postgres resource.

# Required by variables.tf but unused: create_route53_zone is false below, so
# this value is never read. Placeholder only — no real domain needed.

# Redpanda, Loki/Grafana, Prometheus, and pushgateway.
