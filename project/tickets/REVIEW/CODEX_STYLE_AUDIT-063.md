Centralize external command execution behind a typed process API.

**Depends on:** none.

**Problem:** Shell/process execution is scattered across `Sun_cli_shell`,
`Sun_process`, `Sun_cli_manifest`, `Sun_cli_secret`, `cmd_up.ml`,
`cmd_cloud_deploy.ml`, `cmd_logs.ml`, `cmd_status.ml`, `cmd_cloud_tf.ml`, and
`cmd_dev.ml`. Contributors must inspect every call to understand quoting,
stdout/stderr capture, failure handling, and dry-run behavior.

**Goal:** Make external process execution consistent and auditable.

**Acceptance criteria:**

- Create one process abstraction used by CLI code, with argv-native execution,
  optional cwd/env, timeout, echo/redaction, stdout/stderr capture, and typed
  status.
- Mark shell-string execution as explicit and exceptional.
- Convert high-risk `kubectl`, `docker`, `helm`, `terraform`, and `git` paths to
  argv execution.
- Add tests for quoting, non-zero exit status, captured stderr, and redacted
  logging.
