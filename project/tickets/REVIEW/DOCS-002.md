Tutorial `sun dev up` endpoint table lists `Prometheus localhost:9090` — not forwarded

**Description:** `docs/guides/TUTORIAL.md` line 75 lists `Prometheus localhost:9090` in the endpoint table shown after `sun dev up`. `sun dev up` (`cli/sun/bin/cmd_dev.ml`) does not port-forward Prometheus's scrape port at all — it only forwards the Pushgateway to `localhost:9091`. The Prometheus server port 9090 is never exposed on the host.

**Impact:** A user following the Tutorial will try to open `localhost:9090` and get connection refused, breaking trust in the quickstart.

**Remediation:** Replace the `Prometheus localhost:9090` row in the Tutorial endpoint table with `Pushgateway localhost:9091`. Also verify whether the README quickstart has the same error and fix it there too.
