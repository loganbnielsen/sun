Return Result from scaffold domain/name parsing instead of exiting in helpers.

**Depends on:** none.

**Problem:** `cli/sun/lib/sun_cli_cmd_new.ml:130-138` parses `"domain/name"` and
calls `exit 1` from a helper. This hides failure in control flow instead of the
type and makes the parser hard to test independently.

**Goal:** Make scaffold argument parsing typed and testable.

**Acceptance criteria:**

- Change `parse_domain_name` to return `(domain * name, string) result`.
- Keep process exit at the command boundary.
- Add tests for malformed names.
