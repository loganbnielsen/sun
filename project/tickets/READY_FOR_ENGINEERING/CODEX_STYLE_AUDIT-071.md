Make generated CI workflows use the same typed deployment contract as the CLI.

**Depends on:** CODEX_STYLE_AUDIT-061.

**Problem:** Generated GitHub Actions templates in
`cli/sun/lib/sun_cli_scaffold_templates.ml` manually build and push Docker images
before invoking Sun deploy behavior. The CI path can drift from the CLI pipeline
and is hard to reason about as a supported product surface.

**Goal:** Treat scaffolded CI as a thin wrapper around Sun's typed deployment
contract.

**Acceptance criteria:**

- Document the intended generated CI flow in code comments and docs.
- Ensure generated workflows use stable Sun commands for plan/deploy where
  possible instead of duplicating logic.
- Add scaffold tests that assert workflow steps match the deployment pipeline
  contract.
