Reject Prometheus metric family kind conflicts instead of ignoring them.

**Depends on:** none.

**Problem:** `integrations/observability/obs-eio-prometheus/lib/obs_prometheus.ml:59-96`
creates metric families by name, but if a later event uses the same name with a
different kind the code matches `_ -> ()` and silently drops the metric.

**Goal:** Make metric family kind conflicts visible and type-safe.

**Acceptance criteria:**

- Track the registered metric kind for each metric name.
- Return or log a clear error when the same name is used as counter, gauge, and
  histogram inconsistently.
- Add tests for conflicting metric kinds.
