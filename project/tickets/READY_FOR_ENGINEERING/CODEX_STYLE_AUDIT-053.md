Replace hosted model ID aliases with distinct validated ID types.

**Depends on:** none.

**Problem:** `cli/sun/lib/sun_cli_hosted_model.ml:1-5` defines
`account_id`, `project_id`, `environment_id`, `runtime_id`, and `attribution_id`
as aliases of `string`. The compiler cannot prevent swapping them.

**Goal:** Make hosted ownership boundaries type-safe.

**Acceptance criteria:**

- Replace string aliases with private wrapper types or modules per ID kind.
- Keep validated constructors and string conversion helpers.
- Update hosted model, hosted executor, and tests.
