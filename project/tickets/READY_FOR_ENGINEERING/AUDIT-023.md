`sun migrate` missing `--dry-run` flag

**Depends on:** None.

**Description:** The audit runbook invariant requires "sun migrate --dry-run prints the SQL before touching the database." No such flag exists in `cli/sun/bin/cmd_migrate.ml` or the underlying `Migration.apply` in `integrations/storage/sun-storage/lib/migration.ml`.

**Impact:** Operators cannot preview migration SQL before applying to a live database. Risky for production migrations with additive/destructive changes.

**Remediation:** Add `--dry-run` flag to the `apply` subcommand (and the default subcommand path) that reads pending migration files and prints each SQL statement to stdout without executing them against the database.
