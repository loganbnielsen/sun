Implement TLS support in schema registry HTTP client

**Depends on:** None.

**Description:** `parse_base_url` in `integrations/kafka/kafka-eio-service/lib/kafka_service.ml` (lines 38–42) explicitly rejects `https://` URLs with `failwith "HTTPS schema registry not yet supported"`. AUDIT-013 changed this from a confusing DNS error to a clear failure message, but TLS was never implemented. All managed Kafka cloud offerings (Confluent Cloud, MSK, Redpanda Cloud) require HTTPS for their schema registry endpoint.

**Impact:** Sun cannot be used with any managed Kafka offering in production. Every cloud deployment that uses schema validation fails at worker startup with an explicit `failwith`.

**Remediation:**
1. Change `parse_base_url` to return `(string * int * bool)` where the third element is `use_tls`. Parse `https://` prefix and set `use_tls = true`, `port = 443` as default. Keep `http://` → `use_tls = false`, port 80.
2. Thread `use_tls` through `http_do_once` → open a TLS-enabled Eio socket when `use_tls = true`. Use `cohttp-eio` TLS support or `tls-eio` directly.
3. Update callers (`http_post`, `http_get`) and the `parse_base_url` API.
4. Add a test in `kafka-eio-service/test/` that verifies an `https://` URL parses correctly with `use_tls = true` and port 443.
