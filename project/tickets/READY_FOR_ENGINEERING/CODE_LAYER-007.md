## Problem

The four Grafana dashboards Sun ships (`workspace-overview`,
`domain-overview`, `service-template`, `release-timeline`) exist as real
files under `platform/infra/base/dashboards/*.json`, loaded by
`platform/infra/base/main.tf`'s `kubernetes_config_map.grafana_dashboards`
via `file(...)`. `cmd_dev.ml`'s `install_local_grafana_config` instead
applies dashboards from four separate OCaml string literals in
`cli/sun/lib/sun_cli_dev_observability.ml`
(`workspace_overview_json`, `domain_overview_json`, `service_template_json`,
`release_timeline_json`).

A byte-for-byte diff of both copies confirms they are currently identical.
But unlike the Alloy config (CODE_LAYER-006), there is no comment anywhere
in either file flagging that these must be kept in sync — the next dashboard
panel edit made against the `.json` files (the natural place to edit a
Grafana dashboard) will silently leave `sun dev up`'s Grafana on the old
version with no warning at all.

## Goal

`sun dev up` and `platform/infra/base` show the same Grafana dashboards
because they read the same files, not because two copies happen to agree
today.

## Remediation

Delete the four `*_json` string-literal bindings in
`sun_cli_dev_observability.ml`. Have `cmd_dev.ml` read
`platform/infra/base/dashboards/*.json` directly from the Sun monorepo
checkout — `cmd_cloud_tf.ml` already resolves that root via
`Sun_cli_cmd_new.infer_sun_home` for the equivalent "read a file that ships
with the Sun checkout" need (locating `platform/infra/<provider>/`); reuse
the same resolution here instead of embedding a second copy of the JSON.

## Acceptance criteria

- `sun_cli_dev_observability.ml` no longer contains dashboard JSON as OCaml
  string literals.
- `sun dev up`'s dashboard ConfigMap is built from
  `platform/infra/base/dashboards/*.json` directly.
- A fresh `sun dev up` still installs all four dashboards into Grafana
  (verified via the sidecar-loaded ConfigMap or the Grafana UI/API).
- Focused tests pass in `cli/sun`.
