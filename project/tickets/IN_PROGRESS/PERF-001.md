Make slow tests and stale local infra visible by default

**Depends on:** REFAC-066.

## Problem

The repo has per-suite timeouts and timing baselines, but local Docker/k3d
state can sit around for days and distort infra-dependent test behavior. A
service shutdown bug also looked like a slow test until the test process was
timed with a hard kill.

## Goal

Keep the existing test runner simple, but make stale infra and slow suites easy
to reset and diagnose.

## Acceptance criteria

- `run_tests.sh --reset-infra` removes only Sun-owned local containers and the
  `sun-local` k3d cluster before recreating requested infra.
- Timeout handling cannot be bypassed by application SIGTERM handlers when used
  for profiling/checking hangs.
- The runner reports per-suite duration and regression status as it does today.
- Add finer profiling only after a repeat offender needs per-test timing.
