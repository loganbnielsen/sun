Add contributor-facing invariants for generated Kubernetes artifacts.

**Depends on:** CODEX_STYLE_AUDIT-061.

**Problem:** Security and operational invariants such as non-root containers,
read-only filesystems, ClusterIP-only services, NetworkPolicy presence, secret
redaction, and workspace/domain ownership are scattered across manifest tests,
rendering code, and docs.

**Goal:** Make generated artifact invariants obvious and enforce them in one
place.

**Acceptance criteria:**

- Add a documented invariant checklist near manifest rendering or in
  `docs/architecture/devops-pipeline.md`.
- Add a test helper that validates rendered artifacts against these invariants.
- Use the helper across service, worker, function, GitOps, and rollout rendering
  tests.
