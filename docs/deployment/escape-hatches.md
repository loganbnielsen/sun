# Sun Escape Hatches

Sun is opinionated by default. Every generated Deployment enforces non-root
containers, read-only root filesystems, and ClusterIP-only services. These
invariants are not negotiable at any escape-hatch level.

When those defaults are correct but specific deployment parameters need tuning,
Sun provides a four-level escape-hatch hierarchy. Use the lowest level that
solves your problem.

---

## The four-level hierarchy

### Level 1 — `sun.toml` high-level overrides (recommended)

For common per-service customisation. Validated by `sun` at plan time; invalid
values are rejected with a clear error before anything is applied. Values stay
in version control alongside the service source code.

See the [Supported `sun.toml` overrides](#supported-suntoml-overrides) table
below.

### Level 2 — Environment target inputs

For substrate-specific values that differ between environments (e.g. ECR
registry URL, Kubernetes cluster name, base domain). Passed through
`Sun_cli_env_target.t` when building a deployment plan. These are not
per-service — they apply to the entire workspace for a given environment.

Use `sun deploy --registry <url> --image-tag <tag>` or the equivalent
environment target configuration.

### Level 3 — GitOps emit (`sun deploy --emit-to`)

For advanced manifest patching outside Sun's model. `--emit-to <dir>` writes
the complete generated YAML to a directory; a GitOps tool (Argo CD, Flux) or
Kustomize overlay can then patch it before application.

Sun owns the base manifests. Your overlays own the delta. Changes made via
overlays are not visible to `sun inspect` or `sun plan` — treat them as a
seam, not a primary workflow.

### Level 4 — Raw Kubernetes / Terraform (self-managed)

For teams that have outgrown Sun's model entirely. Write your own Deployments,
Services, and Terraform modules. Sun does not generate or manage these
resources. You retain full control and full responsibility.

## Supported `sun.toml` overrides

All overrides live under sections in the per-service `sun.toml` file.

### `[infra.scale]`

| Key        | Type    | Default   | Description                              |
|------------|---------|-----------|------------------------------------------|
| `replicas` | integer | `1`       | Pod replica count                        |
| `cpu`      | string  | `"100m"`  | CPU request and limit (same value)       |
| `memory`   | string  | `"128Mi"` | Memory request and limit (same value)    |

### `[infra.env]`

| Key      | Type          | Default | Description                                      |
|----------|---------------|---------|--------------------------------------------------|
| `config` | inline table  | `{}`    | Extra ConfigMap entries: `{ KEY = "value", ... }` |

Keys in `config` are added to the service ConfigMap alongside Sun's built-in
cluster defaults (Kafka brokers, Loki URL, etc.). They must not override
Sun's reserved keys (`KAFKA_BROKERS`, `SCHEMA_REGISTRY_URL`, `LOKI_URL`,
`PUSHGATEWAY_URL`).

### `[infra.deploy]`

| Key                 | Type   | Default          | Description                                             |
|---------------------|--------|------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|
| `rollout_strategy`  | string | `"RollingUpdate"`| Deployment rollout strategy. Accepted: `"Recreate"`, `"RollingUpdate"`. |
| `ingress_host`      | string | _(match all)_    | Hostname for the Ingress rule. Omit to match all hosts. |
| `ingress_path`      | string | `"/"`            | Path prefix for the Ingress rule.                       |

`rollout_strategy` accepts exactly two values. Any other value is rejected at
plan time:

```
sun.toml: unsupported rollout_strategy "Blue/Green" — valid values are "Recreate" and "RollingUpdate"
```

`ingress_host` and `ingress_path` only affect `-svc` primitives. Workers and
functions do not produce an Ingress resource.

### `[infra.labels]`

| Key            | Type         | Default | Description                                            |
|----------------|--------------|---------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| `extra_labels` | inline table | `{}`    | Additional pod-template labels: `{ key = "value", ... }` |

Extra labels are added to the pod template's `metadata.labels` block alongside
the required `app: <name>` label.

**Guardrail:** Keys starting with `sun.dev/` are reserved for Sun internals.
Attempting to set them raises an error:

```
sun.toml: extra_labels key "sun.dev/owner" is reserved — keys may not start with "sun.dev/"
```

### `[infra.rollout]` — Progressive delivery (Argo Rollouts)

> **Requires Argo Rollouts installed in the cluster.**
> Without it, `kubectl apply` will fail because the `argoproj.io/v1alpha1` CRD
> does not exist. Sun validates the configuration at plan time but cannot verify
> cluster readiness.

This section opts a service into progressive delivery using
[Argo Rollouts](https://argoproj.github.io/argo-rollouts/). Sun renders an Argo
`Rollout` resource instead of a standard `Deployment`. All other resources
(ConfigMap, Secret, ServiceAccount, NetworkPolicy) are unchanged.

This is a **typed high-level escape hatch**, not raw Argo YAML. Sun supports two
strategies with a fixed, validated parameter set. For anything beyond what is
described here, use Level 3 (GitOps overlay) to patch the generated `Rollout`
manifest.

| Key        | Type             | Required | Description                                                         |
|------------|------------------|----------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `strategy` | string           | yes      | Progressive delivery strategy. Accepted: `"canary"`, `"blue-green"`. |
| `steps`    | array of tables  | canary   | Ordered canary steps (required when `strategy = "canary"`).         |

#### Canary strategy

Sun renders a canary `Rollout` with the steps you define. Each step is an inline
table with exactly one key:

| Step form                     | Argo equivalent              | Description                                                 |
|-------------------------------|------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
| `{weight = 10}`               | `setWeight: 10`              | Route 10 % of traffic to the new version.                   |
| `{pause = {}}`                | `pause: {}`                  | Pause indefinitely — requires manual promotion.             |
| `{pause = {duration = 60}}`   | `pause: {duration: 60}`      | Pause for 60 seconds then auto-promote.                     |

Weights must be integers between 0 and 100. Pause durations must be positive
seconds. An empty steps array is rejected at plan time.

```toml
[infra.rollout]
strategy = "canary"
steps = [
  {weight = 10},
  {pause = {duration = 300}},
  {weight = 50},
  {pause = {}},
  {weight = 100},
]
```

A canary `Rollout` for a `-svc` primitive still emits a single ClusterIP
`Service` and an `Ingress`, pointing at the same `app: <name>` selector.

#### Blue-green strategy

Sun renders a blue-green `Rollout` with `autoPromotionEnabled: false`, meaning
the preview version must be manually promoted. No steps are needed.

```toml
[infra.rollout]
strategy = "blue-green"
```

Blue-green emits **two** ClusterIP `Service` resources instead of one:

- `<name>-active` — receives live production traffic.
- `<name>-preview` — receives pre-promotion canary traffic.

The `Ingress` is updated to point at `<name>-active`. Argo Rollouts manages the
pod-selector swap on promotion.

#### Out of scope

The following Argo Rollouts features are not supported through `sun.toml` and
require a Level 3 GitOps overlay if needed:

- Traffic-manager integrations (Istio, NGINX, ALB, Traefik weight annotations).
- `AnalysisTemplate` / automated metric-based promotion.
- Anti-affinity, header-based routing, or mirror traffic.
- `workloadRef` pointing at an existing `Deployment`.

## Non-overridable invariants

The following security defaults are enforced at all times and cannot be
overridden through any escape hatch:

| Invariant                        | Kubernetes field                                          |
|----------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| Non-root container               | `securityContext.runAsNonRoot: true`, `runAsUser: 65534`  |
| No privilege escalation          | `securityContext.allowPrivilegeEscalation: false`         |
| Read-only root filesystem        | `securityContext.readOnlyRootFilesystem: true`            |
| Seccomp runtime default          | `securityContext.seccompProfile.type: RuntimeDefault`     |
| ClusterIP only (no NodePort)     | `spec.type: ClusterIP`                                    |
| Secrets via SecretRef, not values| Secrets are emitted as `Secret` objects, never inline env |

If you need to relax any of these, use Level 3 (GitOps overlay) or Level 4
(raw Kubernetes). Be aware that relaxing them voids Sun's security baseline.

## Example `sun.toml`

Standard deployment with common overrides:

```toml
[infra.scale]
replicas = 3
cpu      = "500m"
memory   = "512Mi"

[infra.env]
config = { APP_ENV = "production", FEATURE_FLAGS_URL = "http://flags.internal" }

[infra.deploy]
rollout_strategy = "Recreate"
ingress_host     = "payments.example.com"
ingress_path     = "/api"

[infra.labels]
extra_labels = { team = "payments", cost-center = "billing" }
```

Progressive delivery with canary steps (requires Argo Rollouts):

```toml
[infra.scale]
replicas = 3

[infra.rollout]
strategy = "canary"
steps = [{weight = 10}, {pause = {duration = 300}}, {weight = 50}, {pause = {}}, {weight = 100}]
```

Progressive delivery with blue-green (requires Argo Rollouts):

```toml
[infra.rollout]
strategy = "blue-green"
```
