(** Decision for where (if anywhere) to push a deploy event, given the
    resolved observability backend and an explicit [--loki-push-url]
    override:
    - [Explicit url] -- the override was given; use it as-is.
    - [Auto_detect] -- [Local]/[Self_hosted_durable] both run their own
      in-cluster Loki; the caller should probe the live cluster for it
      (e.g. `kubectl get svc/loki -n monitoring`) and, if found,
      port-forward to reach it -- this decision layer stays pure and
      leaves that I/O to the caller.
    - [Skip reason] -- nothing to push to and why (currently: the
      [External] backend, which has no in-cluster Loki and no configured
      push URL in [Sun_cli_config]). *)

(** [resolve_push_url ~backend ~explicit_url] decides how to reach Loki for
    a deploy-event push: [explicit_url] always wins; otherwise [Local]/
    [Self_hosted_durable] resolve to [Auto_detect], [External] to
    [Skip _]. *)
