(* Structured Loki release-event line for `sun deploy` (OBS-037). Field set
   mirrors Sun_cli_manifest_yaml.render_taxonomy_labels's taxonomy labels
   (workspace/env/domain/service/primitive/release) so a deployed release's
   manifest labels and its deploy-event log line describe the same release
   consistently, plus a fixed `event=deploy` field OBS-038's dashboard query
   filters on to separate deploy markers from ordinary application log
   lines. Pure/testable; the actual HTTP push and Loki-reachability I/O live
   in cli/sun/bin/cmd_deploy_event.ml. *)

(* Push URL resolution (OBS-037). Same explicit-always-wins precedence as
   Sun_cli_status.probe_url, but for a push target instead of a query
   target:
   - an explicit [--loki-push-url] always wins.
   - [Local]/[Self_hosted_durable] both have an in-cluster Loki
     (platform/infra/base/main.tf's [loki_install_local]) that isn't
     Ingress-exposed -- [Auto_detect] tells the caller it's safe to probe
     the live cluster for it (unlike Sun_cli_status's read-only reachability
     check, [sun deploy]'s direct-apply mode already has kubectl/cluster
     access for its own [kubectl apply], so a live probe is strictly more
     useful here than guessing a static default).
   - [External] never has an in-cluster Loki to find (same
     [loki_install_local] condition excludes it) and no existing
     [Sun_cli_config] target field carries an external push URL --
     [Skip reason] explains why nothing was pushed. *)
