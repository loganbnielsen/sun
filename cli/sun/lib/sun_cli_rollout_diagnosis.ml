     pod completes, before the controller's next reconcile clears it.
   - A pod that has never restarted and is still starting up (no container
     status yet, or Waiting with a benign reason like ContainerCreating /
     PodInitializing): every single invocation passes through this on the
     way to Running, and a short-lived Fn is disproportionately likely to
     be caught mid-startup compared to a steady-state Deployment. Once a
     pod has restarted even once, this leniency no longer applies -- a
     Waiting pod with restart history needs to actually reach Running or
     Succeeded, not just look like it's starting up again mid crash-loop.
   A pod with no restarts and no container status yet is otherwise
   indistinguishable from one that's genuinely unschedulable (insufficient
   resources, no matching node) rather than just starting -- [events] is
   consulted for a [FailedScheduling] event naming this pod to catch that
   case rather than reading it as healthy indefinitely. *)
