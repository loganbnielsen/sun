(** Render a [(namespace_yaml, workload_yaml)] pair from a resolved [service_spec].
    [workspace] plus the spec's [domain]/[primitive] populate the OBS-008
    label taxonomy. Pass [~env] (the resolved deployment environment, e.g.
    ["prod"]) to add the [env] label — omit it for deploys with no resolved
    target (e.g. [sun up]).
    Returns [Ok (ns_yaml, workload_yaml)] on success.
    Returns [Error msg] when [secret_backend = Kubernetes_live] and one or more
    user-declared secret env vars (from [spec.secrets]) are absent from the
    process environment.
    All deployment identity fields (namespace, k8s name, image, primitive,
    config, secrets, schedule, replicas, cpu, memory) come from the spec.
    Pass [~image] to override [spec.image] - used by [sun up] where the
    dry-run display image ([localhost:5000]) differs from the cluster image.
    Pass [~secret_backend] to control how secret manifests are emitted:
    - [Kubernetes_live] (default): emit a Secret with values read from the environment
      (sun up / direct deploy); fails if any user-declared secret key is unset;
    - [Kubernetes_placeholder]: emit a redacted Secret with empty stringData (GitOps);
    - [External_secrets _]: emit an ExternalSecret CRD for the External Secrets Operator. *)
