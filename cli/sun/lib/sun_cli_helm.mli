    such as Alloy's multi-line River configMap content (OBS-039). The temp
    file is removed after the helm invocation regardless of outcome.
    [?version] pins the chart version, passed as [--version] -- omit to take
    whatever the repo's `helm repo update` currently resolves to as latest. *)
