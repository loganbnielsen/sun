(** [rollup_domain_status ~ns_exists diagnoses] aggregates one domain's
    per-service diagnoses (as returned by
    [Sun_cli_rollout_diagnosis.diagnose_service_live] -- [None] means
    healthy, [Some _] means that service's rollout failed) into a single
    domain-level status:
    - [Not_deployed] when the namespace doesn't exist.
    - [Degraded] when the namespace exists and any service is unhealthy.
    - [Healthy] when the namespace exists and every service is healthy. *)

(** [probe_url ~backend ~explicit_url ~default_local_url ~probe_path]

    guess at -- [None] ("don't check") for any other backend. *)

    of [probe_url]: [Not_checked] when there's nothing to check, otherwise
    [Healthy]/[Unreachable] per [is_reachable url]. *)

(* OBS-031: distinguishes "no URL configured" from "URL configured but the
   request failed" -- shared message builders for `sun status` and
   `sun logs` so both commands say the same thing for the same failure. *)

type observability_signal = Loki | Prometheus

(** Message for the "no URL configured" case: no
    [--loki-base-url]/[--prometheus-base-url] flag was given and [backend]
    isn't [Local], so there's no default URL to guess at. Explains why, and
    gives the exact `kubectl port-forward` command plus the flag needed to
    point the CLI at a real cluster. *)
val not_configured_message
  :  signal:observability_signal
  -> backend:Sun_cli_observability_url.backend

(** Message for the "URL configured but the request failed" case --
    deliberately distinct text from [not_configured_message] so a real
    outage or a wrong URL doesn't hide behind wording that looks like the
    normal unconfigured case. *)

(** [reachability_line ~signal ~backend ~probe_url ~is_reachable] renders
    the full message body for one observability signal's status-line entry:
    [not_configured_message] when [probe_url] is [None], ["healthy"] when
    [is_reachable url] succeeds, otherwise [unreachable_message]. [is_reachable]
    is injected (as in [reachability_of_probe] above) so this is directly
    unit-testable without a real curl call -- the I/O stays in
    [cmd_status.ml]. *)

(** [service_is_declared ~k8s_name declared_k8s_names] is [true] when
    [k8s_name] is one of [declared_k8s_names] -- the pure decision behind
    `sun status <domain>/<service>` rejecting an undeclared service
    (OBS-022). Discovering [declared_k8s_names] itself is a filesystem
    scan and stays in [cmd_status.ml]; this is just the set-membership
    check, pulled out so it's directly testable. *)

(** Which health model a declared service's primitive implies: [Fn] is
    [Ephemeral] (CronJob-status diagnosis), [Svc]/[Worker] are
    [Continuous] (live-pod diagnosis). Swapping this mapping would
    silently reintroduce the OBS-024/026 regression (a zero-pod Fn
    reported as failed), so it's pulled out of `cmd_status.ml` to be
    directly unit-tested rather than left as untested glue. *)
