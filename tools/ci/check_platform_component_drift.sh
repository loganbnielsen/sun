#
# Once a Helm value moves into platform/components/<name>/values-*.json, it
# must not creep back as an independently hand-maintained literal in either
# execution layer -- that's exactly how BUG-013 (fixed in
# platform/infra/base/main.tf only) turned into BUG-016 (cmd_dev.ml still
# missing the fix). Deliberately a grep over a fixed key list, not an
# OCaml/HCL AST linter -- see the ADR's "No elaborate lint tooling" rule.
#
# This does not (and cannot, by grepping) prove a *value* is correct -- only
# that a key CODE_LAYER-005 already migrated hasn't reappeared as the exact
# dotted-string form the old `set { name = "..." }` / OCaml `~values:[...]`
# literals used (e.g. "loki.commonConfig.replication_factor"). KNOWN GAP:
# it will NOT catch the same value reintroduced as a nested HCL/OCaml object
# literal instead (e.g. `yamlencode({ loki = { commonConfig = {
# replication_factor = 3 } } })`) -- main.tf already uses that shape
# elsewhere (loki_infra_bindings, prometheus_thanos_server_fields), so it's
# a realistic way for drift to sneak back in undetected. Catching that would
# need real HCL/OCaml parsing, which the ADR explicitly rules out ("No
# elaborate lint tooling") -- reviewers should still eyeball new nested
# object literals touching a migrated component's resource for this.
